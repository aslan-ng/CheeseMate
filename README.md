# ðŸ§€ CheeseMate

Did you know there are more than 2,000 varieties of cheese around the world? At the pace of one cheese per week, it would take nearly 40 years just to try them all! And yet, not every cheese will suit your taste buds: some might be too sharp, too salty, or simply not a good match for your dietary needs. In certain cases, culinary or health restrictions can even make particular cheeses a poor choice.

Thatâ€™s where CheeseMate comes in. Think of it as your friendly cheese specialist: guiding you through the overwhelming world of cheese, helping you discover flavors youâ€™ll love, and steering you safely away from options that donâ€™t fit your preferences or restrictions.

With CheeseMate, exploring cheese becomes less of a gamble and more of an adventure.
